# Contributing

To efficiently address our users' needs, we carefully designed our
contributing guidelines and optimized our issue templates to ensure a
great overall experience with our project.

Our goal is to ensure that our documentation, as well as our issue tracker, are
__well-structured__, __easy to navigate__, and __searchable__, so you can find
what you need quickly and efficiently. Thus, when you follow our contribution
guidelines, we can help you much faster.

In this section, we guide you through our processes.

## Checklist

Before interacting within the project, please take a moment to consider the
following questions. By doing so, you ensure that you use the correct
issue template and provide all necessary information when interacting
with our community.

!!! warning "Issues and comments are forever"

    Please note that everything you write is permanent and will remain
    for everyone to read – forever. Therefore, we kindly ask you to always be
    nice and constructive, complying with our [Code of Conduct].

### Before creating an issue

- Are you using the appropriate issue template, or is there another one
  that better fits the context of your request?

- Have you checked if a similar bug report or change request has already been
  created, or have you stumbled upon something that might be related?

- Did you fill out every field as requested, and did you provide all additional
  information we maintainers need to comprehend your request?

### Before commenting

- Is your comment relevant to the topic of the current issue, or is it a better
  idea to create a new issue, as it's not or only loosely related?

- Does your comment add value to the conversation? Is it constructive and
  respectful to our community and us maintainers? Could you just use a
  [reaction] instead?

### Licensing of contributions

By sharing code within the Zensical ecosystem – including in our
__Discord channel__, __issue tracker__, and __Zensical Spark__ – you agree to
license your contributions under the MIT license. Please note that contributions
are your own and do not fall under Zensical’s jurisdiction; we cannot be held
liable for any issues arising from contributed code.

!!! note "Confidentiality"

    Code shared in private chats or channels within [Zensical Spark] is not
    affected by this requirement and remains under the control and original
    license of the author. Additionally, note that [Zensical offers an NDA].

## Incomplete contributions

We have carefully designed our contribution process to ensure that issues on our
[issue tracker] can be reviewed and addressed efficiently. Each field in our
issue templates is thoughtfully structured to capture the essential details
needed to fully understand your concern.

Therefore, we require all requested information to be provided in full.

The checklist at the end of each template is a tool to help you verify that
you've included everything necessary – it should not be marked off unless each
point has been fully addressed. This ensures that every user and maintainer,
regardless of experience, can properly assess the content and severity of an
issue.

Filling an issue takes time and effort. Before opening one, please use the
search function to avoid any duplicates and ensure your time is well spent. Your
cooperation is crucial in keeping all Zensical platforms constructive and
organized.

__We reserve the right to handle issues that do not adhere to our guidelines as
follows:__

  [issue tracker]: https://github.com/zensical/zensical/issues

### Incomplete issues

We _reserve the right to close issues lacking essential information_, such as
missing [minimal reproductions] or those not adhering to the quality standards
and requirements specified in our issue templates.

We'll reopen an issue once the missing information has been provided.

### Questions as issues

We _reserve the right to close questions opened as any kind of issue_. The
issue tracker is not a place for questions, but rather for detailed
[bug reports], [documentation issues], and [change requests] that adhere to the
quality standards laid out in this guide.

Questions can be asked in our [Discord channel] or within [Zensical Spark].

### Duplicated issues

To maintain organized and efficient communication within our [issue tracker],
we _reserve the right to close any duplicated issues_. Opening multiple
channels to report the same issue hinders our ability to effectively manage and
address community concerns. This approach is vital for efficient time
management, as duplicates can consume the time of multiple team members
simultaneously. Ensuring that each issue or discussion is unique and progresses
with new information helps us to maintain focus and support our community.

### Reopened issues

We further _reserve the right to immediately close issues that are reopened
without providing new information_ or simply because users have not yet
received a response to their issue/question, as the issue is marked as
incomplete.

### Generated issues

While we believe in the value and efficiency that automated tools bring to
identifying potential issues (such as those identified by Lighthouse,
Accessibility tools, and others), simply submitting an issue generated by these
tools does not constitute a complete bug report.

These tools sometimes produce verbose outputs and may include false positives,
which necessitate a critical evaluation. You are, of course, welcome to attach
generated reports to your issue. However, this does not substitute the
requirement for a [minimal reproduction] or a thorough discussion of the
findings.

_We reserve the right to mark these issues as incomplete and close them._ This
practice ensures that we are addressing genuine concerns with precision and
clarity, rather than automated outputs.
