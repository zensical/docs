# Code of conduct

The following is our Code of Conduct, which we expect all users in the Zensical
community to adhere to. Please make sure to thoroughly read and understand these
guidelines before engaging with our community.

## Our pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to
make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Accepted behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for our community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unaccepted behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by users include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic
addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all our platforms and communication channels,
including:

- [Zensical GitHub] repositories
- Zensical [Discord channel]
- Zensical Social Media channels
- [Zensical Spark] space
- Email communication

  [Zensical GitHub]: https://github.com/zensical
  [Discord channel]: https://discord.gg/FDgcZuH7
  [Zensical Spark]: https://zensical.org/spark

All the above platforms are considered part of the Zensical community and are
subject to this Code of Conduct. Beyond our own CoC, each platform may have its
own additional guidelines and rules that users are expected to follow.

## Rights and responsibilities

As maintainers, we are responsible for upholding the integrity and positive
atmosphere of our community. This includes moderating all communication with the
authority to close, remove, reject, or edit issues, comments, commits, and, when
necessary, temporarily or permanently [block users] who __do not align__ with
our [contribution guidelines] and this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

We take any violations seriously and will take appropriate action in response to
uphold these values. Any instance of abusive, harassing, or otherwise
unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Zensical team privately
at contact@zensical.org.

Additionally, if we witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct
ourselves, whether directed at a community member or at the maintainers, we
may take action proactively. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated by
the Zensical team and will be responded to in a way that our team deems
appropriate for the situation.

For this, we have established a clear [warning policy], described below.

  [warning policy]: #warning-policy

## Warning policy

Given the increasing popularity of our projects and our commitment to a healthy
community, we've defined clear guidelines on how we proceed with violations:

### First warning

Users displaying repeated inappropriate, offensive, or harmful behavior will
receive a first warning. This warning serves as a formal notice that their
behavior is not in alignment with our community standards and Code of Conduct.
The first warning is permanent.

### Second warning

If the behavior persists, a second warning will be issued. Upon receiving the
second warning, the user will be given a __5-day reflection period__, during
which they are encouraged to publicly explain or apologize for their actions.
This period is designed to offer an opportunity to openly clear up any
misunderstandings.

### Restriction or blocking

If there is no response or improvement in behavior following the second warning,
we may take further action, including restricting access to [our platforms] or
blocking the user entirely. Blocking is considered a last resort, used only when
absolutely necessary to protect the community's integrity and positive
atmosphere. Decisions regarding restriction or blocking are reviewed by multiple
team members whenever possible to ensure fairness.

Blocking has been an exceptionally rare necessity in our overwhelmingly positive
community, highlighting our preference for constructive dialogue and mutual
respect. It aims to protect our community members and team.
